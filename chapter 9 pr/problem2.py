# The game() function in a program lets a user play a game and returns the score
# as an integer. You need to read a file 'Hi-score.txtâ€™ 
# which is either blank or
# contains the previous Hi-score. You need to write a program to update the
# Hiscore whenever the game() function breaks the Hi-score.
